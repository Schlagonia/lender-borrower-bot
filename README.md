# V2 Base Strategy Adapter

This repo is to allow you to write a strategy for YearnV3 that will work with a Yearn V2 vault.

All adaptations are already implemented in BaseStrategyAdapter.sol.

You will only need to override the three functions in Strategy.sol of '_invest', 'freeFunds' and '_totalInvested'. With the option to also override '_tend' and 'tendTrigger' if needed.
